                        Working with the advertising and tech industries, the UN’s ActNow campaign was launched at COP 24 in December 2018 and has since expanded from a Facebook Messenger bot to an interactive gamified app that helps individuals calculate their sustainable and environmental footprint. Partnerships and collaborations include major movies such as Angry Birds, Smurfs and Trolls movies; as well as world renowned chefs and fashion designers to help spur behaviour change. In 2022, the UN collaborated with the messaging service WhatsApp to reach millions of more users to encourage them to take simple actions to help protect our planet. You can find the website in six languages.</p>

                        Football for the Goals is a United Nations initiative that provides a platform for the global football community to engage with and advocate for the SDGs. It is an opportunity to build on football’s powerful and influential reach and to work together to become agents of change by aligning messaging, strategies and operations with the aspirations of Agenda 2030.

                        Launched by the United Nations in September 2018 by more than 30 founding media organizations – encompassing more than 100 media and entertainment outlets – the SDG Media Compact seeks to inspire media and entertainment companies around the world to leverage their resources and creative talent to advance the Goals.
                        Achieving the SDGs by 2030 will require concerted actions by civil society, businesses, international bodies, organizations of faith, and individuals, among other actors. Media play a particularly critical role in supporting public dialogue and enhancing knowledge on ways to support sustainable development and achieve the Goals.
                        In 2020, the SDG Media Compact welcomed it 100th member.
